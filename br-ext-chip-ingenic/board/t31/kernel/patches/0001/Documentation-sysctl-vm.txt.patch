+extra_free_kbytes
+
+This parameter tells the VM to keep extra free memory between the threshold
+where background reclaim (kswapd) kicks in, and the threshold where direct
+reclaim (by allocating processes) kicks in.
+
+This is useful for workloads that require low latency memory allocations
+and have a bounded burstiness in memory allocations, for example a
+realtime application that receives and transmits network traffic
+(causing in-kernel memory allocations) with a maximum total message burst
+size of 200MB may need 200MB of extra free memory to avoid direct reclaim
+related latencies.
